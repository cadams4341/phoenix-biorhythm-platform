    The [Halberg Chronobiology Center](https://halbergchronobiologycenter.umn.edu){: target="_blank" } at the University of Minnesota develops the basis for a new healthcare program for the prevention of strokes and other effects of cardiac disease.  The mechanism for detecting high risk of stroke and guiding treatment requires “continuous” blood pressure measurements; blood pressure measurements taken approximately every 30 minutes, day and night, in ambulatory fashion, are analyzed via cosinor and cumulative sum.

    The analysis can be automated on, and dispensed from, a worldwide multi-lingual website.  The results of the analysis are to be made available to the patient directly, and when appropriate, to the patient’s healthcare provider.  The associated databases are useful to chronobiology researchers, as they contain physiological data on large numbers of individuals over time as well as physiological and psychological data on populations.

    The chronobiological analyses to be used in the first version of the website are Sphygmochron™ reports (circadian rhythm analysis based on cosinor mathematics) and CUSUM reports (based on cumulative sum mathematics derived from the manufacturing “quality control” arena).  The Sphygmochron detects six Vascular Variability Disorders (VVDs, persistent incorrect circadian rhythm characteristics in blood pressure or heart rate) that act as indicators of risk of stroke.  VVDs are mathematically defined as anomalies in the circadian phase, amplitude, and MESOR (a time-adjusted average) of BP and HR time series, when compared to healthy peers of the same gender and age group.  One VVD is a more precise definition of hypertension than that defined by the WHO, and others VVDs represent independent, additive indicators of stroke risk; an individual with MESOR hypertension, circadian hyper-amplitude tension, excessive pulse pressure, and deficient heart rate variability has a nearly 100% risk of stroke within six years.

    The CUSUM detects the time at which changes in a metric such as SBP MESOR became statistically significant.  The Halberg Chronobiology Center developed a “self-starting CUSUM” that eliminates the need to specify a “target value” to be met.  

    The website will provide the reports and data access mechanisms that meet appropriate security and privacy constraints.  Standard search and relational-database query capability will be provided.  The public-facing website will contain the analysis tools, libraries of reference materials for different audiences (physician, general public, student), lists of commercially-available cABPMs, and connections to popular social networking websites to motivate members of the general public to use the system and disseminate information that they find to be trustworthy and popular.  The social networking mechanisms are designed to allow the general public to collaborate and discover individualized treatments that are more effective than those that have passed one-size-fits-all style clinical trials, and will allow comparative analyses of individual and population based physiological and psychological data, starting with but not limited to their own blood pressure.
