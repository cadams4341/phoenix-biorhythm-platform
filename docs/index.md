## Vision

**{{ config.site_name }}** envision:

1. The use chronobiologic principles (timing according to rhythms) for assessing cardiovascular health, detect pre-disease early, and optimize treatment administration schedules, in order to reduce the number of people who die of preventable heart attacks and strokes.
2. Understanding how blood pressure and heart rate vary in response to stimuli in everyday life for health surveillance and maintenance.

To these ends, The Projects are a collaboration with the University of Minnesota's [Halberg Chronobiology Center](https://halbergchronobiologycenter.umn.edu){: target="_blank" }.

## Mission

**{{ config.site_name }}** will: 

1.  Develop an ambulatory blood pressure monitor

    * Inexpensive
    * Unobtrusive
    * Easy to use
    * Collects a week of blood pressure measurements

2. **Develop a means for chronobiological analysis of the collected blood pressure measurements**

3. Be a learning community

4. Deliver the monitor and analytic framework to the Halberg Chronobiology Center, for long term use on massive scale to:

    * Obtain measures of health
    * Encourage the development of techniques for Diagnosis, Prevention and Treatment

**This website focuses on #2.**

## The Phoenix Learning Community

The **Phoenix Projects** operate as a study group of the [Twin Cities Section of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, IEEE](https://tc-ieee.org){: target="_blank" }. Though the Twin Cities Section is source for the projects' core engineers, the projects welcome students, engineers and scientists regardless of IEEE membership.

The Projects operate on [open source principles](https://opensource.org/osd/){: target="_blank" }, so that it can learn from others and other can learn from it.
