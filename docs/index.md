## What

The vision of the [Halberg Chronobiology Center](https://halbergchronobiologycenter.umn.edu){: target="_blank" }, at the University of Minnesota, is to:

* To use chronobiologic principles (timing according to rhythms) for assessing cardiovascular health, detect pre-disease early, and optimize treatment administration schedules, in order to reduce the number of people who die of preventable heart attacks and strokes.
* To understand how blood pressure and heart rate vary in response to stimuli in everyday life for health surveillance and maintenance.

The Center's scope is global.

To that end, the **IEEE Phoenix Project** serves the vision with two goals:

* Design and build an inexpensive, wearable, unobtrusive, and easy-to-use ambulatory blood pressure monitor.
* Design and build the **Phoenix Biorhythm Platform**, a Web-based platform for the analysis of chronobiological data, and the focus of this site.

See the [Center's vision](vision/abstract.md) of the platform.

## Who

The Phoenix Project operates as a study group of the [Twin Cities Section of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, IEEE](https://tc-ieee.org){: target="_blank" }. Though the Twin Cities Section is source for the project's core engineers, the project welcomes students, engineers and scientists regardless of IEEE membership.
