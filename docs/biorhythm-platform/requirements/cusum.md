**Cumulative sum (CUSUM) analysis** is a statistical method, borrowed from the discipline of manufacturing quality control[^cusum], for detecting a signal that has drifted beyond a target mean and standard deviation. CUSUM can be used to detect unstable motion or small changes in mean, such as linear trends.
The CUSUM detects the time at which changes in a metric such as SBP MESOR became statistically significant.  The Halberg Chronobiology Center developed a “self-starting CUSUM” that eliminates the need to specify a “target value” to be met.
